## About the Project

In this project specifically I had created an API where a user could perform CRUD functions through a HTTP request and it would update the database and display the changes on a page. 

Laravel Sanctum was used to authenticate the HTTP requests to ensure a valid user was performing these requests and not a malicious user. For example, to perform the request you would have been provided a bearer-token to provide before sending the request.

The API testing was done on Postman.
